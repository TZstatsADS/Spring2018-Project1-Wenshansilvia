### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2018

+ Projec title: How does Presidents' inauguration speeches changes by time and how it relates to the history of U.S.? 
+ This project is conducted by [Wenshan Wang]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] The length, sentences distribution, sentiments, and keywords in inaugural speeches are closely related to the social, economic, and political trends in U.S.. In other words, inaugural speeches are snapshots of a slice of U.S. history. During war time, Presidents usually kept their speech short. The sentence length had been falling since George Washington. One possible reason why recent Presidents avoided using long sentence is that they want to reach "the common folks".Another explanation is the rise of anti-intellectualism. The sentiment scores for each speech were lower during the nation's tough time, such as World War 2, 9/11, and Wall Street Crash. "Trust", "joy", and "anticipation" were majority components in speeches that earned high sentiment score, while "anger" and "fear" sentiments were stronger in the speeches that had low sentiment score, especially for those speeches made during war time. In addition, sentiments are more diversified (more colorful in plots) for speeches with lower sentiment score. The keywords in speeches during a certain time are closely related to the hot topics or historical events during that period.
